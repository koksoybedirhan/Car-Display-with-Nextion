The vehicle screen was designed with the Nextion HMI screen to be used in the 2024 Efficiency Challenge Electric Vehicle Races. Arduino and STM32 can be used separately to manage the display, and codes for both are available. With existing codes
speed, remaining energy, total volts, max and min volts, max and min temperature, motor driver phase values, current values ​​of each cell in the BMS are read and visually reflected on the screen. Additionally, vehicle mode and screen brightness can be adjusted on the screen.
